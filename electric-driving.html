      <h3 class="title">Electric driving - Living with an EV</h3>
      <p>Electric cars have many advantages over gas and diesel cars. But making the switch can take some getting used to. This guide answers the most common questions about electric driving and explains how an EV fits into everyday life.</p>

      <h3 class="title">Range</h3>
      <p>On average, Canadian drivers commute between 9 to 15 kilometres a day, a distance that all modern EVs can cover for several days before they need a recharge. Owners of cars with bigger batteries, such a Polestar, can make charging a weekly occurrence.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Factors that affect EV</h3>
        <p>The real-world range of an EV depends on the car itself, driving style, weather and road conditions. Knowing how these factors influence power consumption is beneficial when going on longer trips. For a more detailed explanation, <label for="popup-toggle-factors" class="clickable-text">please click here</label>.</p>

            <h1 class="title popup-title">The car itself</h1>          
            <p>Overall weight, tyre choice, tyre condition and climatisation all affect the number of miles you can get out of a full battery (or a full tank, for that matter). The same goes for mounting a roof box or pulling a trailer. The less power is used to counter rolling resistance or temperature differences, the more energy can be converted into motion.</p>
            <h1 class="title popup-title">Weather and road conditions</h1>          
            <p>Wind, outside temperature and road surface influence the energy needed to propel an EV. Cold weather, for example, makes the battery work harder and can decrease the efficiency of the powertrain depending on the use of climate control. However, preheating the car while it’s being charged will effectively increase its range.</p>
            <h1 class="title popup-title">Driving</h1>          
            <p>Accelerating hard and satisfying the need for speed can be very tempting, especially with the instant power of an EV at your disposal. However, a calmer attitude behind the wheel will ensure that you can go the extra mile(s).</p>

  <h3 class="title">How to extend the range</h3>
  <p>There’s no need for range anxiety. EVs like your Polestar have plenty of stamina for daily commutes and are perfectly suited for longer trips. Read on to find out how to extract even more kilometers from the battery.  For a more detailed explanation, <label for="popup-toggle-extend" class="clickable-text">please click here</label>.</p>

  <input type="checkbox" id="popup-toggle-extend">
  <div class="popup popup-extend">

          <div class="popup-content">
            <img src="../MyFirstWebPage/image/How-to-extend-the-range.png" alt="How-to-extend-the-range">
            <h1 class="title popup-title">Plan your charge</h1>          
            <p>The day before embarking on a long trip, change the charging settings in your car to 100%. Once on the road, it's better to make two stops, charging to 80%, than to stop once to charge to 100%. This is also a time-saving measure, as the final 20% capacity of the battery charges at a much slower rate.</p>
            <h1 class="title popup-title">Manage your speed</h1>          
            <p>Smooth driving with less acceleration and deceleration will extend the range of an EV. The same goes for lowering the cruising speed, as it effectively reduces energy consumption. To help get more kilometres out of a charge, Polestar offers an onboard range assistant that immediately shows the impact of how you’re driving at any given moment. </p>
            <h1 class="title popup-title">Pre-heat and pre-cool</h1>          
            <p>EVs like your Polestar offer pre-entry climate control, allowing the interior to be heated or cooled while the car is being charged. This option provides the optimal interior temperature while also increasing the range of a single charge. </p>
