        <h3 class="title">Precept</h3>
            <p>Polestar revealed the Precept in February 2020 as a declaration of intent. Showcasing the future direction of Polestar’s design, sustainability and technology, the concept makes a strong statement about the brand’s intent. In October 2020, Polestar confirmed that the Precept will be put into production in the future. Polestar is documenting this journey in a YouTube series, “Precept: from concept to car”. In November 2021, Polestar confirmed that the production version of Precept will be known as Polestar 5.</p>
            
               <p>Polestar continues to believe in collaborating with experts to accelerate development and provide customers with the best available technologies. Precept’s interior is defined by sustainability and offered an opportunity to work with new materials and processes. Similarly, the evolution of the HMI builds on current partnerships which maximise the integration of expertise.</p>
            
               <p>Sustainable new interior materials balance modern high-tech luxury with reduced environmental impact. These sustainable materials include recycled PET bottles, reclaimed fishing nets and recycled cork vinyl. A flax-based composite developed by external partner Bcomp Ltd is featured in many interior and some exterior parts. Polestar’s ambition is to bring much of this sustainability into production.</p>

        <h1><a href="gallery.html">Polestar 2</a></h1>
                         <p>Bold yet understated. Futuristic without being flashy. Every millimetre of Polestar 2 has been designed for pure, progressive performance. From the SmartZone in the front to the signature rear light blade, the exterior exhibits a controlled aesthetic that’s quietly distinctive.</p>
          
         <h1> <a href="gallery.html">Polestar 3</a></h1>
                                   <p>Premium electric performance has found a new form. The exterior design of Polestar 3 is defined by sculpted surfaces, discreet details, and optimised aerodynamics for a sleeker, more technical look.</p>
